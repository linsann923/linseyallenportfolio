<!--Introduction-->
<div class="container">
    <div class="row">
        <div class="column col-md-6 col-lg-7">
            <h2>Context</h2>
        <p>
            It was my first week of UI/UX bootcamp, and I wanted to take up a passion project as a problem solving exercise. I am enthusiastic about my local community and wanted to solve the booking issues in my local rec center's app.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Provo Recreation Center is highly reputable and caters to children, adults, seniors, families, even animals (enjoy this photo of my dog at their puppy pool party)! The amenities and services are top-notch, especially the child watch care services! For very cheap, mothers can sign up for hours of babysitting while they attend fitness classes and community events. However, the quality of the services are not reflected in the iPhone version of the scheduling app.

<!--Problem Section-->
<div class="container">
    <div>
        <h2>The Problem?</h2>
        <p>The child watch book system is hard to find and overwhelming. See for yourself! Try reading the info paragraph from the reservation page.</p>
        <p>“Single reservation maximum: 60 min. Must be made 1 hour in advance on same day. Parents can sign up for a maximum of 120 min per child, using up to 2 reservations per morning and evening. If unable to attend, please cancel reservation using the app (up to 1 min prior), or call 801-852-7630 to cancel during reservation time. Failure to cancel 3 times within 30 days will result in a 1 week reservation suspension. For children ages 6 months to 8 years old. $3 per child per hour, and $2 per hour for each additional sibling. Parents will pay at check out. Must have signed waiver before being allowed to drop off a child. No outside food/drink/toys allowed inside. If children are showing any symptoms of sickness, they may not be able to enter. Additional rules and regulations applicable--please see guest service staff for details.”</p>
        <p>It's gnarly to read, isn't it? Now, try saying it ten times fast!</p>
        <p>While I believe that users are resilient and able to adjust to an imperfect UX system, I wanted to help local families have a smoother experience scheduling child care so that young parents could feel more at ease with the quality of the system.</p>
        <p>Although I wasn't sure what the design process looked like, the natural first step seemed to be gaining insights from real users.</p>
    </div>
</div>

<!--User Research Section-->
<div class="container">
    <div>
        <h2>User Research</h2>
        <p>I texted, called, and face-timed with friends and acquaintances. As I spoke with these users, people consistently expressed a general dislike for the current app. Each interviewee provided good insights into the challenges they faced as a Provo Rec App user.</p>
        <h3>Results</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>The Child Watch Center allows members to book up to 120 minutes of child care per morning and evening. This key info is not explained well in the description. One interviewee had to call the rec center to clarify the scheduling policy!</li>
            <li>The Child Watch Center is closed everyday from 1-4 pm. This information is never overtly pointed out. One mom thought that those time slots were just full everyday.</li>
            <li>You can't see what you've reserved in the same place. Some users suggested that having a daily overhead would help with forgetting prior sign-ups.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
</div>

<!--User Flows and Wireframes-->
<div class="container">
    <div>
        <h2>User Flow</h2>
        <p>My first hurdle was to learn how to conceptualize the route the user should take. I felt that key check points were missing in the existing design, and I eventually decided to add a home page and an intake process for first time users. </p>
    </div>

        </picture>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>Wireframes</h2>
        <p>Learning to turn solutions into visuals was an even greater challenge. I had no knowledge of industry standards for booking systems, nor the design experience to initially create a legible wireframe (you could use my first wireframe for blackmail). Identifying what was essential to include and how to design it in a cohesive way took time and became easier the longer I was in my design program. I kept progressing in my skills and continued revising until I landed the right design.</p>

    </div>
</div>

<!--Elements and Solutions-->
<div class="container">
    <div>
        <h2>Elements and Solutions</h2>
        <p>It initially felt so complex to put together, but I found simple UI patterns to create the right experience. Some key additions included:</p>

    </div>
</div>

<!--Final Look-->
<div class="container">
    <div>
        <h2>Final Look</h2>
        <p>I wanted a design that felt family friendly, fun, and clean while simultaneously reflecting the outdoors of Provo, Utah. I changed the original colors into a teal palette. All the buttons had green elements. All icons are dark and simple. I kept the nature theme consistent throughout.</p>

<!--Conclusion-->
<div class="container">
    <div>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>My first experience with the UX design process was about learning how to take something complicated and simplify it. It is one thing to study UX, another thing entirely to practice it. This was not a perfect process, but it was a valuable one!
            In terms of the UI design, I wanted the app to feel family friendly, fun, and clean, while simultaneously reflecting the mountain ranges of Provo, Utah. Here's the final look!</p>
